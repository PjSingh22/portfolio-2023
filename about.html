    <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2><br>
    <h4>Education:</h4>
    <p>I am currently finishing my degree in Technology and Information Management at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and will be obtaining my bachelor's degree in June of 2020. As a T.I.M student, I can offer the skills and experience in technology-focused creativity, strong communication, and engaging presentation skills gained through my teamwork focused major within the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Interests:</h4>
    <p>I love coding. Ever since writing my first program, I became obsessed with the idea of using logic and creativity to create and solve practical problems. Along with my computer-centered education at UC Santa Cruz, I have balanced school work with coding bootcamps on the Udemy learning platform with Python, SQL, as well as front end web development. This is what keeps me up at night, the belief of the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
    <p>Wake up, gym, sleep, repeat. Fitness has been a passion of mine over the last few years, where I have become obsessed with the idea of pushing myself to new heights, both physically and mentally. Everyday, when I walk into that weight room, the adversities of everyday life go away, and my focus is only geared towards one thing, my training. Many of the lessons I took away from fitness have transitioned into both my professional and personal life, where if youâ€™re not hard on yourself, someone else will be, and the amount of reward you get only comes from how much work you put in. Stay positive, stay consistent, and trust the process!</p>
